# Algorithm-Checkpoint
# first one:
this Algorithm is meant to take a whole sentence as an input, and analyze it to get the number of words inside it, and then then number of vowels it contains (by checking for vowels: a e i o u A E I O U), all of that while using only three counters.

# secound one:
this algorithm is meant to take a whole array and sort it using insertion sort, which will take an element with index i, and try to insert it in its corresponding position in the array from 0 to i-1.
